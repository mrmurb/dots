This is a ~~super awesome~~ repo containing my personal dotfiles.

I run this configuration on my laptop, using **[i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)** on **[ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org)**.

This is by no means a configuration which just "works". As of now it's rather plain, boring and dull. But ricing is not done over night.

Dependencies
------------
Some of these are not really dependencies as much as recommendations for nice software. But most of the things is going to be integrated sooner or later.

* `compton` - Compositor for X (GPU Acceleration, fades, shadows and more goodies)
* `conky` - System monitor. Magic stuff.
* `nitrogen` - Because it just works. (Wallpaper)
* `oh-my-zsh` - I like zsh, I don't like configurating zsh. Find it [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
* `vimconf` - Same reason as above. Find this one [here](https://github.com/timss/vimconf).
* [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) - Font, best there is. Well one of the top 10.
* `ranger` - CLI File Browser.
* `xprop` - Handy tool when configurating i3.
